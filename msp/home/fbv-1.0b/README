1. OVERVIEW
    fbv (FrameBuffer Viewer) is a simple program to view pictures on
  a linux framebuffer device. In 2000, when fbv was created, there
  were no other situable programs performing the same task, so the
  authors decided to follow the rule: 'If you need a tool - write
  it yourself!' :-)

2. REQUIREMENTS
  - Linux, configured to provide the framebuffer device interface
    (/dev/fb0 or /dev/fb/0)
  - libungif for GIF support
  - libjpeg for JPEG support
  - libpng for PNG support

3. INSTALLATION
  - unpack the archive (you've propably already done it)
  - run ./configure
  - type: make
  - type: make install
  - enjoy...

4. USAGE
    Just run fbv without any arguments, and a short help message
  will appear...

6. BUGS & TODO

  - the english in messages is not the best at all :-)
