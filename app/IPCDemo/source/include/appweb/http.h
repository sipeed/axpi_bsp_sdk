    Create a URI link
    @description Create a URI link based on a given target relative to the current request.
        This API expands embedded tokens based on the current request and route state. The target URI parameter
        may contain partial or complete URI information. The missing parts are supplied using the current request
        and route tables.
    @param [in] conn HttpConn connection object
    @param target The URI target. The target parameter can be a URI string or JSON style set of options.
        The target will have any embedded "{tokens}" expanded by using token values from the request parameters.
        If the target has an absolute URI path, that path is used directly after tokenization. If the target begins with
        "~", that character will be replaced with the route prefix. This is a very convenient way to create application
        top-level relative links.
        \n\n
        If the target is a string that begins with "{AT}" it will be interpreted as a service/action pair of the
        form "{AT}Service/action". If the "service/" portion is absent, the current service is used. If
        the action component is missing, the "list" action is used. A bare "{AT}" refers to the "list" action
        of the current service.
        \n\n
        If the target starts with "{" it is interpreted as being a JSON style set of options that describe the link.
        If the target is a relative URI path, it is appended to the current request URI path.
        \n\n
        If the is a JSON style of options, it can specify the URI components: scheme, host, port, path, reference and
        query. If these component properties are supplied, these will be combined to create a URI.
        \n\n
        If the target specifies either a service/action or a JSON set of options, The URI will be created according
        to the route URI template. The template may be explicitly specified
        via a "route" target property. Otherwise, if an "action" property is specified, the route of the same
        name will be used. If these don't result in a usable route, the "default" route will be used.
        \n\n
        These are the properties supported in a JSON style "{ ... }" target:
        <ul>
            <li>scheme String URI scheme portion</li>
            <li>host String URI host portion</li>
            <li>port Number URI port number</li>
            <li>path String URI path portion</li>
            <li>reference String URI path reference. Does not include "#"</li>
            <li>query String URI query parameters. Does not include "?"</li>
            <li>service String Service name if using a Service-based route. This can also be specified via
                the action option.</li>
            <li>action String Action to invoke. This can be a URI string or a Service action of the form
                {AT}Service/action.</li>

        Queue's provide open, close, put, and service methods. These methods manage and respond to incoming packets.
        A queue can respond immediately to an incoming packet by processing or dispatching a packet in its put() method.
        Alternatively, the queue can defer processing by queueing the packet on it's service queue and then waiting for
        it's service() method to be invoked.
        \n\n
        If a queue does not define a put() method, the default put() method will

    Borrow a connection
    @description Borrow the connection from Http. This effectively gains an exclusive loan of the connection so that it
    cannot be destroyed while the loan is active. After the loan is complete, you must call return the connection
    by calling #httpReturnConn. Otherwise the connection will not be freed and memory will leak.
    \n\n
    The httpBorrowConn routine is used to stabilize a connection while interacting with some outside service.
    Without this routine, the connection could be destroyed while waiting. Many things can happen while waiting.
    For example: the client could disconnect or the connection could timeout. These events will still be serviced
    while the connection is borrowed, but the connection object will not be destroyed.
    \n\n
    While borrowed, you must not access the connection using foreign / non-MPR threads. If you need to do this,
    use #mprCreateEvent to schedule an event to run on the connection's event dispatcher.
    This is essential to serialize access to the connection object.
    Inside the event callback, you should first check the connection state via HttpConn.state to ensure the request
    is still active. If the request has completed, the state will be HTTP_STATE_COMPLETE.
    \n\n
    Before returning from the event callback, you must call #httpReturnConn to end the exclusive loan.
    This restores normal processing of the connection and enables any required I/O events.

/**
    Add caching for response content
    @description This call configures caching for request responses. Caching may be used for any HTTP method,
    though typically it is most useful for state-less GET requests. Output data may be uniquely cached for requests
    with different request parameters (query, post, and route parameters).
    \n\n
    When server-side caching is requested and manual-mode is not enabled, the request response will be automatically
    cached. Subsequent client requests will revalidate the cached content with the server. If the server-side cached
    content has not expired, a HTTP Not-Modified (304) response will be sent and the client will use its client-side
    cached content.  This results in a very fast transaction with the client as no response data is sent.
    Server-side caching will cache both the response headers and content.
    \n\n
    If manual server-side caching is requested, the response will be automatically cached, but subsequent requests will
    require the handler to explicitly send cached content by calling #httpWriteCached.
    \n\n
    If client-side caching is requested, a 'Cache-Control' Http header will be sent to the client with the caching
    'max-age' set to the lifespan argument value (converted to seconds). This causes the client to serve client-cached
    content and to not contact the server at all until the max-age expires.
    Alternatively, you can use #httpSetHeader to explicitly set a 'Cache-Control' header. For your reference, here are
    some keywords that can be used in the Cache-Control Http header.
    \n\n
        'max-age' Maximum time in seconds the resource is considered fresh.
        's-maxage' Maximum time in seconds the resource is considered fresh from a shared cache.
        'public' marks authenticated responses as cacheable.
        'private' shared caches may not store the response.
        'no-cache' cache must re-submit request for validation before using cached copy.
        'no-store' response may not be stored in a cache.
        'must-revalidate' forces clients to revalidate the request with the server.
        'proxy-revalidate' similar to must-revalidate except only for proxy caches.
    \n\n
    Use client-side caching for static content that will rarely change or for content for which using 'reload' in
    the browser is an adequate solution to force a refresh. Use manual server-side caching for situations where you need to
    explicitly control when and how cached data is returned to the client. For most other situations, use server-side
    caching.
    @param route HttpRoute object
    @param methods List of methods for which caching should be enabled. Set to a comma or space separated list
        of method names. Method names can be any case. Set to null or '*' for all methods. Example:
        'GET, POST'.
    @param uris Set of URIs to cache.
        If the URI is set to '*' all URIs for that action are uniquely cached. If the request has POST data,
        the URI may include such post data in a sorted query format. E.g. {uri: /buy?item=scarf&quantity=1}.
    @param extensions List of document extensions for which caching should be enabled. Set to a comma or space
        separated list of extensions. Extensions should not have a period prefix. Set to null, '' or '*' for all extensions.
        Example: 'html, css, js'. The URI may include request parameters in sorted www-urlencoded format. For example:
        /example.esp?hobby=sailing&name=john.
    @param types List of document mime types for which caching should be enabled. Set to a comma or space
        separated list of types. The mime types are those that correspond to the document extension and NOT the
        content type defined by the handler serving the document. Set to null or '*' for all types.
        Example: image/gif, application/x-php.
    @param clientLifespan Lifespan of client cache items in milliseconds. If not set to positive integer,
        the lifespan will default to the route lifespan.
    @param serverLifespan Lifespan of server cache items in milliseconds. If not set to positive integer,
        the lifespan will default to the route lifespan.
    @param flags Cache control flags. Select HTTP_CACHE_MANUAL to enable manual mode. In manual mode, cached content
        will not be automatically sent. Use #httpWriteCached in the request handler to write previously cached content.
        \n\n
        Select HTTP_CACHE_CLIENT to enable client-side caching. In this mode a 'Cache-Control' Http header will be
        sent to the client with the caching 'max-age'. WARNING: the client will not send any request for this URI
        until the max-age timeout has expired.
        \n\n
        Select HTTP_CACHE_RESET to first reset existing caching configuration for this route.
        \n\n
        Select HTTP_CACHE_SERVER to define the server-side caching mode.
        \n\n
        Select HTTP_CACHE_UNIQUE to uniquely cache requests with different request parameters.

            <li>Request fields - these are request state and property values.</li>
        </ul>
        System and URI tokens are of the form: "${token}" where "token" is the name of the variable or URI token.
        Request fields are of the form: "${family:name=defaultValue}" where the family defines a set of values.
        If the named field is not present, an optional default value "=defaultValue" will be used instead.

        <ul>
            <li>header - for request HTTP header values</li>
            <li>param - for request params</li>
            <li>query - for request query field values</li>
            <li>request - for request details</li>
            <li>Any URI pattern  token</li>
        </ul>
        For example: "run ${header:User-Agent}" to select the client's browser string passed in the HTTP headers.
        For example: "run ${field:name}" to select the client's browser string passed in the HTTP headers.
        For example: "run ${name}.html" where {name} was a token in the route pattern.
        For example: "run ${name}.html" where {name} was a token in the route pattern.
        The supported request key names are:
        <ul>
            <li>clientAddress - The client IP address</li>
            <li>clientPort - The client port number</li>
            <li>error - Any request or connection error message</li>
            <li>ext - The request extension</li>
            <li>extraPath - The request extra path after the script extension</li>

    @param route Route to modify
    @param name Target rule to add. Supported update rules include:
        "close", "redirect", "run" and "write".
        \n\n
        The "close" rule is used to do abortive closes for the request. This is useful for ward off known security attackers.
        For example: "close immediate". The "close" rule takes no addition parameters.
        \n\n
        The "redirect" rule is used to redirect the request to a new resource. For example: "redirect 302 /tryAgain.html".
        The "redirect" takes the form: "redirect status URI". The status code is used as the HTTP response
        code. The URI can be a fully qualified URI beginning with "http" or it can be a relative URI.
        \n\n
        The "run" target is used to run the configured handler to respond to the request.
        For example: "file ${DOCUMENTS}/${request.uri}.gz".
        \n\n
        The "write" rule is used to write literal data back to the client. For example: "write 200 Hello World\r\n".
        The "write" rule takes the form: "write [-r] status message". Write data is by default HTML encoded to help
        eliminate XSS security exposures. The "-r" option selects "raw" output and bypasses the HTML encoding of the
        write data string.
        \n\n
        WARNING: Take great care when using raw writes with tokens. Write data is not HTML encoded and echoing back to
        raw data to the client can cause XSS and other security issues.

    \n\n
    This routine can operate in a blocking, non-blocking or buffered mode. Blocking mode is specified via the HTTP_BLOCK
    flag. When blocking, the call will wait until it has written all the data. The call will either accept and write all
    the data or it will fail, it will never return "short" with a partial write. If in blocking mode, the call may block
    for up to the inactivity timeout specified in the conn->limits->inactivityTimeout value.
    \n\n
    Non-blocking mode is specified via the HTTP_NON_BLOCK flag. In this mode, the call will consume that amount of data
    that will fit within the outgoing WebSocket queues. Consequently, it may return "short" with a partial write. If this
    occurs the next call to httpSendBlock should set the message type to WS_MSG_CONT to indicate a continued message.
    This is required by the WebSockets specification.
    \n\n
    Buffered mode is the default and may be explicitly specified via the HTTP_BUFFER flag. In buffered mode, the entire
    message will be accepted and will be buffered if required.
    \n\n
    This API may split the message into frames such that no frame is larger than the limit conn->limits->webSocketsFrameSize.
    However, if the HTTP_MORE flag is specified to indicate there is more data to complete this entire message, the data
    provided to this call will not be split into frames and will not be aggregated with previous or subsequent messages.
    i.e. frame boundaries will be presserved and sent as-is to the peer.
    \n\n
    In blocking mode, this routine may invoke mprYield before blocking to consent for the garbage collector to run. Callers
    must ensure they have retained all required temporary memory before invoking this routine.

        you must set the type to WS_MSG_CONT for the

    @param len Length of msg
    @param flags Include the flag HTTP_BLOCK for blocking operation or HTTP_NON_BLOCK for non-blocking. Set to HTTP_BUFFER to

        Include the flag HTTP_MORE to indicate there is more data to come to complete this message. This will set
        frame continuation bit. Setting HTTP_MORE preserve the frame boundaries. i.e. it will ensure the data written is
